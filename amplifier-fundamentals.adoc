== Introduction

This chapter discusses the fundamentals of amplifiers and how we talk about and analyze them.
These concepts apply to _all_ amplifiers regardless of how they are constructed internally.

What makes this way of thinking about amplifiers so powerful is that we can separate how the the amplifier is _used_ in a larger system from how it is _constructed_ internally.
At any given time, a person is only concerned about one of these aspects and can therefore effectively _not care_ about the other.


== Pre-requisites

We start with amplifiers which behave the same at all frequencies.
This means that we are ignoring capacitors, inductors, and any frequency-dependence of devices such as transistors.

<<LEC>> has a well-written tour of this material in Chapters 1 through 10 of https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/[Lessons in Electric Circuits: Volume 1 - Direct Current^].

Most important to how we view amplifiers are the wonderful concept-tools of Th√©venin (mostly) and Norton (some) equivalent circuits.
You can find more discussion and worked examples at <<CL-book>>'s section https://www.circuitlab.com/textbook/thevenin-equivalent-and-norton-equivalent-circuits/[Thevenin Equivalent and Norton Equivalent Circuits^].



Any and all of *linear circuit theory* is necessary for analyzing amplifiers, especially including:

* Components
** Ideal independent and dependent sources: *VCVS*, *VCCS*, CCVS, CCCS.
** Resistors, capacitors, inductors.
* Techniques for analysis
** Nodal analysis
** Thevenin / Norton equivalent circuits
** Apparent resistance
* AC circuits with complex-valued impedances using the Laplace transform




== lower UPPER signal notation

There are several ways to view a circuit besides trying to find the circuit equations directly in the time domain.
This is especially [.line-through]#terrible# difficult when there are semiconductors or other non-linear devices in the circuit besides R, L, C, and sources.
To help deal with the complexity, we view circuits from two major perspectives: DC and AC.


Study <<t-signal-notation>> for a bit and notice how _every_ current or voltage can be espressed using the "`__lower~UPPER~__`" notation on the first and last line of the table.

== AC equivalent circuits

* Set all DC independent sources to zero.
** V-sources &rarr; short-circuit
** I-sources &rarr; open-circuit

* Redraw the circuit.




== Small-signal equivalent circuits

* Find the AC equivalent circuit.
* Decide which inductors and capacitors _function_ as **BFC**s or **BFL**s.
* Keeping in mind your _frequencies of interest_, decide to whether to keep *or* simplify additional inductors and capacitors.
* Replace each transistor with its small-signal model.
* Re-draw the circuit.

I first learned of the **B**ig **F**at **C**apacitor and **B**ig **F**at **L** (inductor) from Chapter 15 of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521835399/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=agnd-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0521835399&linkId=a191c5e9c542a181b851ec5f82a84b75[Thomas Lee's _The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Circuits, 2nd ed._ (affiliate link)^]

A *BFC* is a capacitor whose value has no effect on the frequency response of the circuit by behaving as a _short-circuit_ at all frequencies of interest, while still blocking DC current flow.
Similarly, a *BFL* behaves like an _open-circuit_ at all frequencies of interest, while maintaining a path through it for constant DC current.

These are *only* for simplifying a discussion or analysis.
When you simulate or build a circuit containing a BFC or BFL, you will need to choose an appropriate value.  (Watch out for _self-resonance_ and other issues in physical parts!)
