Our tour through semiconductor physics will focus on the main features that are relevant to a circuit designer -- those that affect the behavior with respect to voltage and current.
The foggy valleys where the underlying quantum-mechanical properties that form the base of these features will be left for a different, more focused, exploration.

Similarly, if stem:[\left(N_A - N_D\right) \gg 2 n_i], then we can approximate stem:[p \approx \left(N_A - N_D\right)].

---



== Charge carriers

The basic physics of an atom's structure tells us that electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged.
Current in amperes is moving charge in coulombs per second.
Therefore, current in electronics can be due to electrons moving or protons moving.

Before moving on, here is a reliable saying:

> If your protons are moving, you have bigger problems.

Electronics with semiconductors is frequently called "`solid-state`" for a good reason --- our materials are (all) in the solid state of matter!

Protons moving means your material is in a _liquid_ or, heavin forbid, a _gaseous_ or _plasma_ state.
Surely you recognize that this cannot possibly end well :)


Electrons moving is totally fine.
In fact, electrons moving in free space between electrodes is fundamentally what is happening in vacuum tubes.
The vacuum just ensures that the electrons don't collide with other (air) molecules while in motion.


[sidebar]
====
This is why the field is called **electron**ics!

Moving positive charges in the form of _ions_ does happen in processes like electrolysis used in electroplating, for example, but that bumps up against chemistry and is out of our scope for now.
====


Negatively-charged electrons in motion are our only currents.
Keep reading for how we fake having positive charges also moving inside semiconductors.


=== Intrinsic

An intrinsic semiconductor is a material that has no added impurities.
Its electrical properties therefore are determined only by the properties of the material itself.

// TODO: electron-hole pair generation
//  video of shaking the box!

The concentration of thermally-generated electron-hole pairs varies (lots!) with temperature, and is:

[stem]
++++
n_i = B \cdot T^{3/2} \cdot \exp\left(\dfrac{-E_g}{2 k_B T}\right) \;\; \mathrm{\#/cm^3}
++++


It is much more common when calculating numbers to need _n~i~^2^_:

[stem]
++++
n_i^2 = B^2 T^3 \exp{\left(\dfrac{-E_g}{k_B T}\right)}
++++

The constant _B_ is derived from material properties related to allowable energy levels an electron can occupy in a crystal.


The *law of mass action* relates the concentrations of free electrons and holes under thermal equilibrium:

// TODO explain this invariant
[stem]
++++
n\cdot p = n_i^2
++++

This equation holds for all semiconductors.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_action_law_(electronics)[Wikipedia: Mass action law (electronics)^] for a short description and more references.

=== Extrinsic / Doping

Adding impurities to the crystal from Group III or IV elements (replacing an Si atom with another atom such as B or P) also adds extra electrons or holes to the structure.

* Dopants which add extra _free electrons_ are called *donors*, with concentration stem:[N_D \;\; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}].

* Dopants which add extra _(free) hole's_ are *acceptors*: stem:[N_A \;\; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}].


// TODO net charge notes and handout
Even when doped, a semiconductor crystal has no net charge.


[stem]
++++
\sum \text{charges} = q \left( +N_D + p - N_A - n \right) = 0
++++

This, combined with the *law of mass action* fundamental relationship

[stem]
++++
n\cdot p = n_i^2
++++

Allows us to calculate the concentration of _free electrons_ and _holes_ for any doping condition (always choose the stem:[+] version because the number must be non-negative):

[stem]
++++
n = \dfrac{(N_D - N_A) \pm \sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 n_i^2}}{2} \; \text{ and } \; p = \dfrac{n_i^2}{n}
++++

or, solved the other way:

[stem]
++++
p = \dfrac{(N_A - N_D) + \sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4 n_i^2}}{2} \; \text{ and } \; n = \dfrac{n_i^2}{p}
++++

*Q:* Are the above two sets of solutions equivalent?

*Q:* Does it matter which set to use depending on which of stem:[N_D] or stem:[N_A] is larger?

When we dope in practice, the impurities stem:[N_D] and/or stem:[N_A] are in the range stem:[10^{14} \text{ to } 10^{21} \; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}], which is much greater than stem:[n_i] at normal temperatures.
Therefore we use the following approximations all the time:

[stem]
++++
\text{when $N_D$ is largest:  } n \approx N_D \text{  and  } p \approx \frac{n_i^2}{N_D}
++++

[stem]
++++
\text{when $N_A$ is largest:  } p \approx N_A \text{ and } n \approx \frac{n_i^2}{N_A}
++++

*Notice* how only the minority carrier concentrations are affected by temperature (holes for n-type doping, electrons for p-type doping).



=== Conclusions

* stem:[n_i] is _very_ sensitive to temperature changes
* We can change the concentration of free electrons (_n_) and (free) holes (_p_) by *doping*.
* Minority carrier concentrations are greatly affected by temperature.  Majority carriers not so much.



== Semiconductor currents

=== Summary
Two mechanisms of movement with two types of charge carriers yields four types of current in a semiconductor.

=== Drift

==== Physics phundamentals

* An electron in an electric field experiences a force.
* This force causes the electron (which has mass) to accelerate.
* *Why* does this not therefore cause an _increasing_ current in a material?

.Think about this question, then <click to reveal>
[%collapsible]
====
[sidebar]
****
The electrons are scattered by the solid -- always accelerating but constantly getting knocked off track.

Notice in this video during the Plinko game (around 3:00), the *camera pans downward* at an _approximately constant rate_:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7DKxe_m1AM[YouTube: The Price is Right former biggest Plinko win primetime^].


This results in an _average velocity_ which is constant even though an individual electron is _always_ accelerating.footnote:[and therefore also creating a magnetic field!]
****
====


The average electron velocity is proportional to the applied E-field.

[stem]
++++
v \propto \vec{E}
++++

The constant of proportionality is called *mobility* (&mu;~n~ for electrons and &mu;~p~ for holes) and must have units of stem:[\mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}].

For silicon, these values are around:

* stem:[\mu_n = 1350 \; \mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}]
* stem:[\mu_p = \phantom{1} 480 \; \mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}]

Recall that the *electric potential difference* that we commonly name by its units of *volts* is only and truly the _path integral of the electric field_.
Fortunately, the E-field is a _conservative field_, so the result of the integration only depends on the end points:


[stem]
++++
\mathrm{V(olts)_{ab}} = - \int_a^b \vec{E}\,dl
++++


For holes:: stem:[\vec{v}_h = \mu_p \vec{E}], movement in the same direction as the stem:[\vec{E}] field vector.

For electrons:: stem:[\vec{v}_e = -\mu_n \vec{E}], movement in the *opposite* direction as the stem:[\vec{E}] field vector.





==== Current flow in a bar

> Imagine a bar of silicon

Let's begin by considering the current that flows due to electrons.

[#f-bar]
.Voltage source connected across a (semi)conductor bar.
image::semi-bar-vsource.svg[]


We know the electron (average) velocity, the density of (free) electrons, and the geometry of the bar.

image::current-drift-electron.svg[]


NOTE: Notice the double negative!  Each negative has a different origin even though the net result is a positive sign.

Let's normalize this into a current *flux* by dividing by the cross-sectional area _W&centerdot;h_.footnote:[Everyone _else_ calls _J_ "`current density,`" but the quantity is flow / area, which is a *flux* in my book (and the customary term from calculus).]

[stem]
++++
J_n = \frac{I_n}{W\cdot h} = \mu_n \vec{E} \cdot n \cdot q
++++

NOTE: _J~n~_ has units of stem:[\mathrm{A / cm^2}] which is the units of a flow per unit area or *flux*.  In an unfortunate naming convention, everyone else calls this term electron *current density*.

By the same reasoning, we can find the hole *current density*


image::current-drift-hole.svg[]

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_p &= \left(\text{hole velocity}\right) \left(\text{charge density}\right) \\
    &= \left(\mu_p \vec{E}\right) \left(p \cdot q\right)
\end{align}
++++

The total *drift current density* is then

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_{total}(\mathrm{drift}) &= J_n + J_p \\
          &= q \left( \mu_n n + \mu_p p \right) \cdot \vec{E} \;\; \mathrm{A/cm^2}
\end{align}
++++


Finding the *current* that you would measure with an ammeter from this expression merely requires multiplying by the cross-section area of the bar.


// TODO: what about non-uniform cross-sectional area?


But... look back at <<f-bar>> and see that we are applying a *voltage* across the ends of the bar (using an ideal voltage source) -- what is stem:[\vec{E}]?

An easy-ish way to remember what to do is to recall the _units_ of the electric field: volts per meter.
We get our voltage back by multiplyiing by meters, or the __L__ength of the bar.

[stem]
++++
\vec{E} = \frac{V_{ab}}{L}
++++

[sidebar]
****
This only works if the cross-section area is uniform along the length of the bar.

Think about what would happen if the middle of the bar was necked down to a smaller area.
KCL forces the *current* to be constant so therefore {insert thinking here}.

.What causes this second-order effect? <think first, then click to reveal>
[%collapsible]
====
* More doping means a less uniform crystal and more opportunities for scattering.
* But (free) charge density increases faster than mobility decreases, so conductivity still increases.
====



==== Velocity saturation

It hopefully makes sense that the charge _velocity_ can't increase so much as to exceed the speed of light, so this is the obvious speed limit.
(Light speed is about stem:[3\times 10^{10}\;\mathrm{cm/s}])

The velocity (therefore current) approaches a lower limit and no longer varies linearly at large E-field strengths (voltage).
In a circuit context, this means that the device changes from behaving like a *resistor* to more like a *constant current source*.footnote:[that still absorbs energy]
*Velocity saturation* is very common in modern integrated circuits.

which is well within the velocity saturation regime according to <<f-vel-sat>>.

=== Diffusion


// TODO: replace this figure with my own
image::razavi-fig2_11.png[]





image::current-diffusion-electron.svg[]



image::current-diffusion-hole.svg[]


The total *diffusion current density* is then

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_{total}(\mathrm{diff}) &= J_n + J_p \\
          &= q \left( D_n \frac{\delta n}{\delta x} - D_p \frac{\delta p}{\delta x} \right) \; \mathrm{A/cm^2}
\end{align}
++++


Look back at <<t-four-currents>> and match the terms we've just worked through.
*Only* one term has a negative sign, hole diffusion, _be careful_ to not make sign errors!


== Junctions

The *goal* of these subsections is to develop a model of the _pn_ junction that is useful for circuit design and analysis.
We will end up with a relationship between current and voltage, and another expression for junction capacitance (charge storage).


=== _pn_ junction in equilibrium

.Semiconductor bar doped half _p_-type and half _n_-type
image::semi-bar-junction.svg[]


image::diode-symbol.svg[]

Imagine taking two separate bars of silicon, one doped to be _n_-type (N~D~) and the other doped to be _p_-type (N~A~).
Push these bars together so that there is a single bar where the middle abruptly changes doping types and levels.

At the moment of contact, there is a huge concentration *gradient* for both holes and electrons.
The _p_-type region with a majority of holes is right next to the _n_-type region with very few holes and vise versa.


[#f-semi-bar-initial]
.Initial diffusion currents at the junction.
image::semi-bar-initial.svg[]


NOTE: The _n_ and _p_ sides are reversed compared to previous figure.  This is to match our other reference materials.


This large gradient causes the holes at the edge of the _p_ region to flow via *diffusion* to the low concentration side and electrons at the edge of the _n_ region flow via *diffusion* the opposite direction.
Because of the opposite signs for charge polarities and movement direction, the net diffusion current is in the same direction, which is to the left in <<f-semi-bar-initial>>.


After a long time, this diffusion will eventually stop because the electron and hole densities have become uniform:

image::semi-bar-junction-charges.svg[]

{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +


WARNING: *NO !!!*  We have forgotten about the *protons* that are in this material!


> If your protons are moving, you have bigger problems.


Think about the Group IV dopant atom (say phosphorus) on the _n_ side of the junction.
That extra electron (and extra proton!) is in a region of many free electrons and next to a region with few.
So it will tend to move (diffuse) to the right towards the _p_ region.


image::semi-bar-junction-ions.svg[]


This particular free electron came from the 5^th^ outer valence electron of the phosphorus dopant atom.
Therefore, when it diffuses away, the 15^th^ proton in the nucleus is left without a charge-balancing mate.
We now have a &plus;1 positively-charged phosphorus *ion*.

Similarly, when the hole contributed by the Group III dopant (say boron) on the _p_ side diffuses to the left, we remember that the hole was filled with an electron.
This electron fills the 4^th^ outer valence "`slot`" and completes the covalent bonding structure in that area.
Don't forget that boron is short a proton that matched the now-filled hole.
Therefore the region has a net &minus;1 negatively-charged boron *ion*.

Both of these types of ions _cannot move_ because the charges are either a) part of the nucleus, or b) a *bound* electron.
This means that we have:


[verse]
____
Charges
      In
    Spaaace footnote:[https://youtu.be/EmI77ZBeJrQ[(not) The Muppets^]]
____


or called the *depletion region* because the volume is eventually depleted of free charge carriers.

Now that there are separated charges, Gauss' law, stem:[\nabla \! \left(\epsilon \vec{E}\right) = Q], implies that there is a non-zero E-field inside the depletion region.
This field is maximum at the boundary between the _n_ and _p_ type doping and, for this example, points to the right.


image::semi-bar-junction-depletion.svg[]


Recall that the *diffusion* currents are to the _left_ and the drift current from the E-field is opposite, to the _right_.
Because this semiconductor bar is not connected in a circuit, *KCL* forces the current at every _x_ location to be zero.
The junction is in *equilibrium* and the drift and diffusion currents must be equal and opposite.


[stem]
++++
\left| J_p(\mathrm{drift}) + J_n(\mathrm{drift}) \right| = \left| J_p(\mathrm{diff}) + J_n(\mathrm{diff}) \right|
++++


CAUTION: *NO !* (again).  The currents must be balanced for holes and electrons *individually*, or it makes no physical sense.

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_p(\mathrm{drift}) + J_p(\mathrm{diff}) &= 0 \\
J_n(\mathrm{drift}) + J_n(\mathrm{diff}) &= 0
\end{align}
++++

Take the free electrons equation and substitute their definitions:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
q \mu_n n \vec{E} &= -q D_n \frac{d n}{dx} \\
- \mu_n n \frac{d V}{dx} &= -D_n \frac{d n}{dx} \\
\end{align}
++++


Integrate and divide both sides by _n_

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\mu_n \int\limits_b^a dV &= -D_n \int\limits_{n_p}^{n_n} \frac{d n}{n}\\
V(a) - V(b) &= -\frac{D_n}{\mu_n} \ln \left(\frac{n_p}{n_n}\right) \\
\end{align}
++++

The left side is the potential difference developed across the depletion region and is given the symbol stem:[V_0].
Also, recall Einstein's relation, stem:[\frac{D}{\mu} = \frac{k_B T}{q}], and substitute

[stem]
++++
V_0 = \frac{k_B T}{q} \ln \left(\frac{n_n}{n_p}\right)
++++

We usually are only concerned with the _magnitude_ of V~0~; notice that swapping the fraction so the majority carriers term (_n~n~_) is in the numerator cancels the leading negative sign.
Recognize, for the next section, that the *higher* potential is on the _n_ side, at location _b_, given the E-field direction.
A similar process can be done to find V~0~ from the hole currents.


One final set of substitutions using our (good) approximations of majority and minority carrier concentrations

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
&n_n \rightarrow N_D \\
&n_p \rightarrow \frac{N_A}{n_i^2}\\
\\
V_0 &= \frac{k_B T}{q} \ln \left(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\right)\\
    &= V_T \ln \left(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\right)
\end{align}
++++


where stem:[V_T] is called the *thermal voltage*.


[sidebar]
====
stem:[V_T = \frac{k_B T}{q}] is something you should memorize.

* It is 25.85{mV} at 300{K} (26.85&deg;C)

Both 25{mV} and 26{mV} are used in practice for hand calculations at "`room temperature.`"
You will also see 40 = 1/0.025 in equations.
Because V~T~ is usually inside an exponent, the numerical result of a calculation can be sensitive to which approximation you used.
Therefore it is best to _state_ your assumptions instead of assuming the reader rounds the same direction as you do.
