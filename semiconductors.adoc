Our tour through semiconductor physics will focus on the main features that are relevant to a circuit designer -- those that affect the behavior with respect to voltage and current.
The foggy valleys where the underlying quantum-mechanical properties that form the base of these features will be left for a different, more focused, exploration.

== Charge carriers

=== Intrinsic

An intrinsic semiconductor is a material that has no added impurities.
Its electrical properties therefore are determined only by the properties of the material itself.

// TODO: electron-hole pair generation
//  video of shaking the box!

The concentration of thermally-generated electron-hole pairs varies (lots!) with temperature, and is:

[stem]
++++
n_i = B \cdot T^{3/2} \cdot \exp\left(\dfrac{-E_g}{2 k_B T}\right) \;\; \mathrm{\#/cm^3}
++++


The constant _B_ is derived from material properties related to allowable energy levels an electron can occupy in a crystal.


The *law of mass action* relates the concentrations of free electrons and holes under thermal equilibrium:

// TODO explain this invariant
[stem]
++++
n\cdot p = n_i^2
++++

This equation holds for all semiconductors.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_action_law_(electronics)[Wikipedia: Mass action law (electronics)^] for a short description and more references.

=== Extrinsic / Doping

Adding impurities to the crystal from Group III or IV elements (replacing an Si atom with another atom such as B or P) also adds extra electrons or holes to the structure.

* Dopants which add extra _free electrons_ are called *donors*, with concentration stem:[N_D \;\; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}].

* Dopants which add extra _(free) hole's_ are *acceptors*: stem:[N_A \;\; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}].


// TODO net charge notes and handout
Even when doped, a semiconductor crystal has no net charge.


[stem]
++++
\sum \text{charges} = q \left( +N_D + p - N_A - n \right) = 0
++++

This, combined with the *law of mass action* fundamental relationship

[stem]
++++
n\cdot p = n_i^2
++++

Allows us to calculate the concentration of _free electrons_ and _holes_ for any doping condition (always choose the stem:[+] version because the number must be non-negative):

[stem]
++++
n = \dfrac{(N_D - N_A) \pm \sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4 n_i^2}}{2} \; \text{ and } \; p = \dfrac{n_i^2}{n}
++++

or, solved the other way:

[stem]
++++
p = \dfrac{(N_A - N_D) + \sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4 n_i^2}}{2} \; \text{ and } \; n = \dfrac{n_i^2}{p}
++++

*Q:* Are the above two sets of solutions equivalent?

*Q:* Does it matter which set to use depending on which of stem:[N_D] or stem:[N_A] is larger?

When we dope in practice, the impurities stem:[N_D] and/or stem:[N_A] are in the range stem:[10^{14} \text{ to } 10^{21} \; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}], which is much greater than stem:[n_i] at normal temperatures.
Therefore we use the following approximations all the time:

[stem]
++++
\text{when $N_D$ is largest:  } n \approx N_D \text{  and  } p \approx \frac{n_i^2}{N_D}
++++

[stem]
++++
\text{when $N_A$ is largest:  } p \approx N_A \text{ and } n \approx \frac{n_i^2}{N_A}
++++

*Notice* how only the minority carrier concentrations are affected by temperature (holes for n-type doping, electrons for p-type doping).



=== Conclusions

* stem:[n_i] is sensitive to temperature changes
* We can change the concentration of free electrons (_n_) and (free) holes (_p_) by *doping*.
* Minority carrier concentrations are greatly affected by temperature.  Majority carriers not so much.



== Semiconductor currents

=== Summary
Two mechanisms of movement with two types of charge carriers yields four types of current in a semiconductor.


.Types of charge movement

Drift:: constant velocity proportional to E-field
Diffusion:: movement from high to low concentration

=== Drift

==== Physics phundamentals

* An electron in an electric field experiences a force.
* This force causes the electron (which has mass) to accelerate.
* *Why* does this not therefore cause an _increasing_ current in a material?

.Think about this question, then <click to reveal>
[%collapsible]

[sidebar]
****
The electrons are scattered by the solid -- always accelerating but constantly getting knocked off track.

Notice in this video during the Plinko game (around 3:00), the *camera pans downward* at an _approximately constant rate_:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7DKxe_m1AM[YouTube: The Price is Right former biggest Plinko win primetime^].


This results in an _average velocity_ which is constant even though an individual electron is _always_ accelerating.footnote:[and therefore also creating a magnetic field!]
****
====


The average electron velocity is proportional to the applied E-field.

[stem]
++++
v \propto \vec{E}
++++

The constant of proportionality is called *mobility* (&mu;~n~ for electrons and &mu;~p~ for holes) and must have units of stem:[\mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}].

For silicon, these values are around:

* stem:[\mu_n = 1350 \; \mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}]
* stem:[\mu_p = \phantom{1} 480 \; \mathrm{\frac{cm^2}{V\cdot s}}]

Recall that the *electric potential difference* that we commonly name by its units of *volts* is only and truly the _path integral of the electric field_.
Fortunately, the E-field is a _conservative field_, so the result of the integration only depends on the end points:


[stem]
++++
\mathrm{V(olts)_{ab}} = - \int_a^b \vec{E}\,dl
++++


For holes:: stem:[\vec{v}_h = \mu_p \vec{E}], movement in the same direction as the stem:[\vec{E}] field vector.

For electrons:: stem:[\vec{v}_e = -\mu_n \vec{E}], movement in the *opposite* direction as the stem:[\vec{E}] field vector.





==== Current flow in a bar

> Imagine a bar of silicon

Let's begin by considering the current that flows due to electrons.

[#f-bar]
.Voltage source across a conductive bar
image::current-flow-bar.png[]

image::current-drift-electron.svg[]


NOTE: Notice the double negative!  Each negative has a different origin even though the net result is a positive sign.

We know the electron (average) velocity, the density of (free) electrons, and the geometry of the bar.
Let's normalize this into a current *flux* by dividing by the cross-sectional area _W&centerdot;h_.

[stem]
++++
J_n = \frac{I_n}{W\cdot h} = \mu_n \vec{E} \cdot n \cdot q
++++

NOTE: _J~n~_ has units of stem:[\mathrm{A / cm^2}] which is the units of a flow per unit area or *flux*.  In an unfortunate naming convention, everyone else calls this term electron *current density*.

By the same reasoning, we can find the hole *current density*


image::current-drift-hole.svg[]

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_p &= \left(\text{hole velocity}\right) \left(\text{charge density}\right) \\
    &= \left(\mu_p \vec{E}\right) \left(p \cdot q\right)
\end{align}
++++

The total *drift current density* is then

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_{total}(\mathrm{drift}) &= J_n + J_p \\
          &= q \left( \mu_n n + \mu_p p \right) \cdot \vec{E} \;\; \mathrm{A/cm^2}
\end{align}
++++


Finding the *current* that you would measure with an ammeter from this expression merely requires multiplying by the cross-section area of the bar.


// TODO: what about non-uniform cross-sectional area?


But... look back at <<f-bar>> and see that we are applying a *voltage* across the ends of the bar (using an ideal voltage source) -- what is stem:[\vec{E}]?

An easy-ish way to remember what to do is to recall the _units_ of the electric field: volts per meter.
We get our voltage back by multiplyiing by meters, or the __L__ength of the bar.

[stem]
++++
\vec{E} = \frac{V_{ab}}{L}
++++

[sidebar]
****
This only works if the cross-section area is uniform along the length of the bar.

Think about what would happen if the middle of the bar was necked down to a smaller area.
KCL forces the *current* to be constant so therefore {insert thinking here}.

.What causes this second-order effect? <think first, then click to reveal>
[%collapsible]
====
* More doping means a less uniform crystal and more opportunities for scattering.
* But (free) charge density increases faster than mobility decreases, so conductivity still increases.
====



==== Velocity saturation

It hopefully makes sense that the charge _velocity_ can't increase so much as to exceed the speed of light, so this is the obvious speed limit.
(Light speed is about stem:[3\times 10^{10}\;\mathrm{cm/s}])

The velocity (therefore current) approaches a lower limit and no longer varies linearly at large E-field strengths (voltage).
In a circuit context, this means that the device changes from behaving like a *resistor* to more like a *constant current source*.footnote:[that still absorbs energy]
*Velocity saturation* is very common in modern integrated circuits.

which is well within the velocity saturation regime according to <<f-vel-sat>>.

=== Diffusion


// TODO: replace this figure with my own

image::current-diffusion-electron.svg[]



image::current-diffusion-hole.svg[]


The total *diffusion current density* is then

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
J_{total}(\mathrm{diff}) &= J_n + J_p \\
          &= q \left( D_n \frac{\delta n}{\delta x} - D_p \frac{\delta p}{\delta x} \right) \; \mathrm{A/cm^2}
\end{align}
++++


Look back at <<t-four-currents>> and match the terms we've just worked through.
*Only* one term has a negative sign, hole diffusion, _be careful_ to not make sign errors!


== Junctions


=== _pn_ junction in equilibrium

Imagine two separate bars of silicon, one doped to be _n_-type and the other doped to be _p_-type.
Push these bars together so that there is a single bar where the middle abruptly changes doping types and levels.
At the moment of contact, there is a huge concentration gradient for both holes and electrons.
The _p_-type region with a majority of holes is right next to the _n_-type region with very few holes.

This large gradient causes the holes at the edge of the _p_ region to flow to the low concentration side and electrons at the edge of the _n_ region flow the opposite direction.
Because of the opposite signs for charge polarities and movement direction, the net diffusion current is in the same direction.
