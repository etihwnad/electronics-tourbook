.Basic bipolar differential pair

We first start our foray into the world of differential circuits by considering the basic bipolar differential pair in <<f-diff-pair-bjt-basic>>.

* Set the two input voltages to zero.

.What is the emitter voltage _v~E~_?  (think of the answer before revealing!)
[%collapsible]
====
The base voltages are the same because they are set to be so, the emitter voltages are the same because they are attached to the same node.

_v~BE~_ is about 0.6{V}, so _v~E~_ is about &minus;0.6{V}
====

{br}

This is not a problem so far, but what happens when *V1* and *V2* are _not_ equal?
Is this even possible?
How can *V1* be anything different if _v~BE~_ is supposed to always be 0.6{V}?

****
Wait a second:  *why* "`must`" _v~BE~_ be 0.6{V} in the first place?

It is merely an _approximation_ of the base-emitter voltage in *active* mode that causes collector currents somewhere around 1{mA} at around room temperature (300&nbsp;K).
****

This connection forces us to use a more accurate approximation for the collector current, see xref:bjt-review.adoc#t-bjt-modes[Table: Bipolar transistor modes]:


[stem]
++++
i_E = \dfrac{i_C}{\alpha} = \dfrac{I_S}{\alpha} \exp\left(\frac{v_{BE}}{V_T}\right)
++++

KCL forces the emitter currents to sum to *I~tail~*.
A substitution for each transistor's current gives us:

[stem]
++++
I_{tail} = \frac{I_{S2}}{\alpha_2} \exp\left(\frac{v_{BE2}}{V_{T2}}\right) +  \frac{I_{S2}}{\alpha_2} \exp\left(\frac{v_{BE2}}{V_{T2}}\right)
++++

_So many_ currents and voltages -- take a minute to list out which are actually transistor properties and not part of the circuit analysis, but just have units of {V} or {A}.

* stem:[I_{S1}] and stem:[I_{S2}] -- depend on individual doping, geometry, and other manufacturing variations (and junction temperature)
* stem:[V_{T1}] and stem:[V_{T2}] -- thermal voltage stem:[k_B T / q], transistors _may_ be at different temperatures!

Since the emitters are connected together, we can write the base-emitter voltages as

* stem:[v_{BE1} = v_1 - v_E]
* stem:[v_{BE2} = v_2 - v_E]


.Assumptions
[sidebar]
****
To proceed much more and arrive at the important result of this path, we need to make two assumptions:

. Both transistors are at the *same temperature*.
. The transistors are *matched*, meaning:
* stem:[I_{S1} = I_{S2} = I_S], and
* stem:[\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha]
. Then, purely and only for convenience, we'll approximate stem:[\alpha \approx 1]
****

Now, factor the common _v~E~_ term out of the exponentials.

[stem]
++++
I_{tail} = I_S \exp\left(\frac{-v_E}{V_T}\right) \left[\exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{v_2}{V_T}\right) \right]
++++

and rearrange for later use

[stem]
++++
I_S \exp\left(\frac{-v_E}{V_T}\right) =
\frac{I_{tail}}{\exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{v_2}{V_T}\right)}
++++

Follow this progression for the collector current in transistor *Q1* (each step is simple!):

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
i_1 &= I_S \exp\left(\frac{v_{BE1}}{V_T}\right) \\
&= I_S \exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) \exp\left(\frac{-v_E}{V_T}\right) \\
& \\
&= I_S \exp\left(\frac{-v_E}{V_T}\right) \exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) \\
& \\
&= \dfrac{I_{tail} \exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{v_2}{V_T}\right)}
\end{align}
++++

Then multipy by "`1,`" an algebra trick that is handy in many situations:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
i_1 &= \dfrac{I_{tail} \exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{v_1}{V_T}\right) + \exp\left(\frac{v_2}{V_T}\right)} \cdot \dfrac{\exp\left(\frac{-v_1}{V_T}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{-v_1}{V_T}\right)} \\
& \\
&= \dfrac{I_{tail}}{1 + \exp\left(\frac{-(v_1 - v_2)}{V_T}\right)} \\

\end{align}
++++
